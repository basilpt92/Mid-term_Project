                                  Predictive Modelling of Household Prices

**Introduction and Briefing**

The dataset consisted of historic data of houses sold between May 2014 to May 2015. 
The Objective is to is to build a model that will predict the price of a house based on features provided in the dataset. There are certain characteristics for those houses (Price range of $650 and above), which will be detrimental in increasing the value of it. 
So we are given the data set which have these characteristics features such as price, condition, Sqft to name a few.

**Exploring the dataset**

  Python and its libraries are used for data exploration. The planned action consist   of 
    -- Identification of variables and data types.
    -- Dealing with missing value in the dataset.
    -- Categorising(shaping) the data.
    -- Identifying the correlations and outliers 
          
**Data Visualisation for more insights**

**Designing the correlation to find out the relationship within the dataset**

**Data transformation to differentiate categorical and numerical structure of the database.**

**Further data processing with normalisation and plotting the data.**

**Developing the model **

**Testing the model**
